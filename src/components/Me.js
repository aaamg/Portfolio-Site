            <h6>(outside of the work face/resume stuff, that is boring!)</h6>
            <p>I have a degree in History from Louisiana State University</p>
            <p>Why did I choose History?</p>
            <p>History, in my opinion, is the most important subject. It encompasses everything. From medicine, to the arts, agriculture, music, literature... With History, you can dive into endless topics and expand your knowledge (especially if you enjoy a wikipedia binge). Frankly, I love History. It's endless and keeps happening. Specificly though, I love European History.</p>
            <p>Why do you program then if you have a History major?</p>
            <p>I've enjoyed programming on and off as a hobby for years, in University i had a job writing HTML/CSS & JavaScript. this job opened my eyes to a career as a dev. Working with people on projects solving problems was an eye opener. I'm a bit of a lone wolf, so naturally I like to study/research on my own, but programming turned me into an outgoing person. I later attended a school for a year (40+ hrs a week programming, more time spent than in Univeristy frankly...) to become a skilled developer.</p>
            <p>Outside of programming and History I enjoy videogames. I am a high level Rocket League and fairly decent DOTA 2 player, I enjoy strategy games (ex: HOI4, CK2, EU4), and still play Old School RuneScape after all these years.</p>
            <p>I used to coach for $ on Rocket League; if you would like coaching, feel free to reach out.</p>
            <p>I am profocient in Norwegian (Bokm√•l); B1 level. I have a fascination with Norway, even though I have 0 cultural ties to the nation (that I know of).</p>
            <p>For hobbies I love college football, hiking, gaming, skiing, talking about the AKM platform, learning Norsk, hanging out with my friends... typical stuff I would say.</p>
